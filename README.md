# BG



Background substraction using median and unique gaussian algorithms 


to test the code in the command line  : 

python Backgroung-mediane.py filepath

OR 

python unique_gauss.py filepath


where file path is the path to the dataset + radical , for example for a dataset images named a1 .. a99999 it should be path/a

for a dataset of images named 1 .. 99999 then it should be just the path/
